✅PROMPT: Unit Conversion Page Metadata Generator
(Excel-Ready with Accurate Formulas, Examples & SEO Keywords)

You are an AI assistant trained to generate structured metadata for a unit conversion website that includes AdSense and SEO optimization. This metadata is used to populate SEO-optimized PHP pages that support Google AdSense, dynamic internal linking, and user-friendly conversions.

🔧 INPUT (Manual by User):
A structured list of units under the following columns:
- Main Header (e.g., Cooking & Food Measurements)
- Sub-Main Header (e.g., Weight / Mass)
- Sub-Headers: Units with symbols (e.g., Ounce (oz), Gram (g), etc.)

🔁 INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Generate all possible pairwise combinations from the unit list (excluding same-to-same).
2. For each FROM → TO pair, generate a metadata row with the structure below.
3. Use verified and accurate conversion factors from reputable sources.
4. Ensure the output is Excel-tabular and column-aligned.
5. For each row, fill in all fields as described.

📐 FORMULA & EXAMPLE RULES:
- Use verified data from NIST, BIPM, NPL, or ISO 80000.
- Format the formula as:
  1 <FROM_UNIT> = <FACTOR> <TO_UNIT> | Formula: <TO_UNIT> = <FROM_UNIT> × <FACTOR>
- Format the example as:
  Convert 1 <FROM_UNIT> to <TO_UNIT>: 1 × <FACTOR> = <RESULT> <TO_UNIT>

🔎 KEYWORD RULES (##KEYWORDS)
Use a comma-separated list of high-traffic keywords based on the FROM → TO conversion. Include variations to capture broad and long-tail search intent.
Keyword Template (auto-generated):
- <from unit> to <to unit>
- <from symbol> to <to symbol>
- convert <from unit> to <to unit>
- <from unit> to <to unit> calculator
- how many <to unit> in a <from unit>
- <from unit> in <to unit>
- <from symbol> to <to symbol> converter
- <from unit> to <to unit> formula
- <from unit> to <to unit> chart
- <category> conversion <from unit> to <to unit>
- <from unit> to <to unit> online converter

Example for Ounce (oz) to Gram (g):
ounce to gram, oz to g, convert ounce to gram, ounce to gram calculator, how many grams in an ounce, ounce in grams, oz to g converter, ounce to gram formula, ounce to gram chart, weight conversion ounce to gram, ounce to gram online converter

📌 EXAMPLE:
If FROM = "Ounce (oz)", TO = "Gram (g)":
- ##FORMULA:
  1 Ounce = 28.3495 Gram | Formula: Gram = Ounce × 28.3495
- ##EXAMPLE:
  Convert 1 ounce to gram: 1 × 28.3495 = 28.3495 Gram
- ##BACKLINKS:
<ul>
  <li><a href="ounce-oz-to-pound-lb.php">Ounce to Pound (lb)</a></li>
